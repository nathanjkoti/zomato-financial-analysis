# 📊 Zomato Financial Performance Dashboard

This Power BI project explores the financial performance of Zomato across 11 quarters, using real time investor-reported data from Q1 FY21 to Q3 FY24. It was developed as a practical application of the concepts I learned during my Business Analyst internship at VR Education.

## ✨ Why This Project?

I’ve always been drawn to **analytics** — not just because of the numbers, but because of how **data visualization combines logic with creativity**. There’s something deeply satisfying about turning rows of financial data into visuals that instantly communicate meaning. At the same time, I’ve long been fascinated by **finance** and the way money flows through systems, companies, and economies.

This project gave me the perfect space to bring both interests together — to work with real-world financial data, extract insight, and present it in a clean, interactive, and story-driven way.
